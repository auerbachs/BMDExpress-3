 BMDExpress 3
</h1>


<h2>Version <MAJOR_VERSION> BUILD <SUBVERSION_VERSION_NUMBER> released on August 8, 2025</h2>

<h3>
New Features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>zscore</li>
<li>model fold change</li>
<li>latest toxicr</li>
<li>update mle aic/p-value to use degrees of freedom in line with bmds 2.7</li>
<li>library updates</li>
<li>json export additions</li>

</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue flagging hill models when BMD is below the lowest dose. Previously the application interpreted 1/3 as 1/4 and 1/2 as 1/3 due to a bug creating the flag hill ratio value.
</li>

</ul>


<h2>Released on August 8, 2024</h2>

<h3>
New Features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Added venn diagram visualizations to category analysis and BMD analysis results viewers.</li>
<li>Add upstream analysis notes to exported files.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue calculating BMD values on downward trending non-log transformed expression data using BMR Type of Relative Deviation.</li>

</ul>




<h2>Released on August 28, 2023</h2>
<h3>
New Features
</h3>
<ul>
<li>R Squared calculation for modeled curves</li>
<li>Step Function detection for modeled curves</li>
<li>Export curve response data</li>
<li>Add category analysis filter parameters</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Min/Max number of genes in geneset</li>
<li>Is step function</li>
<li>Is step function with BMD less than lowest dose</li>
<li>R Squared</li>
</ul>


</ul>

<h3>
Bug Fixes
</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue when running multiple One Way Anova analyses causing LOTEL/NOTEL 
calculation to shuffle p-value and fold change parameters in GUI. This was not an issue when running one dataset at a time and in the command line version </li>
<li>Fixed issue cause by invalid default folder path for exporting and importing data.</li>


</ul>
